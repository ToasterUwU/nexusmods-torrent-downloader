The idea is to make a program that registeres as a link handler for NexusMods downloads, and then gives out torrent files for these exact files for faster downloads.

This is a curiosity and hobby project. In reality, the available torrent list will be incomplete (since i didnt download absolutely every file from NexusMods) and the speeds will also be limited unless loooooots of people picked up on this project and use it.
